- Relay has been used to completly cut off servo power (in my case it buzzes all the time)
- **9V battery meets NodeMCU 1.0 specification, however it may exceed max voltage for your board. If not, I still recommend additional cooling for voltage regulator (I used radiator meant for raspberry pi usb controller)**
- Use larger servo motor (mine is too small) to make a mechanism stronger in case when someone wants to open locked door
